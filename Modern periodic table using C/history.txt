Atomic theory dates back to the ancient Greek philosophers and those of Hellenistic Egypt. They theorized that all substances were made of fundamental building blocks; however, the nature of those blocks was the object of fierce debate.
The fundamental blocks were called atoms, derived from the Greek “atmos,” meaning “indivisible.” Early atomic theory attempted to explain properties of matter by assigning attributes to atoms that might match the attributes of the various matter they combined to form, such as slipperiness, liquidity, color, and cohesiveness. Philosophers categorized the world around them by property and function, a type of approach that later led to the development of the periodic table of elements.
In the Middle Ages, practitioners of alchemy sought to make gold and silver from lead. Although their efforts were in vain, their investigation has ultimately led to a systematic understanding of the chemical world. It also established the mindset that gave us the periodic table of elements.
Alchemists were influenced by international trade, especially along the Silk Road between China and Europe. Chemical knowledge spread across cultures, and by about the middle of the 18th century, there were already 33 known elements. At the beginning of the 19th century, Joseph Proust and others were demonstrating the Law of Definite Proportions experimentally. This provided fundamental evidence that matter existed in pure compounds as opposed to just mixtures of any proportion. These observations strengthened the atomic theory and demanded a systematic method of organizing the elements.

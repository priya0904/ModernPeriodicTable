I) The arrangement of the elements is based on a more fundamental property namely atomic number.

II) In this periodic table the position of an element is related to the electronic configuration of its atom.

III) It explains the similarities and variations in the properties of the elements in terms of electronic configuration and brings about clearly the trends in chemical properties across the long periods.

IV) The inerts gases having completely filled electron shells have been placed at the end of each period. Such a location of the inert gases represents logical completion of each period.

V) The greatest advantage of this periodic table is that this be divided into four block elements namely s-, p-, d-, and f-block elements.

VI) It provides a clear position of different types of elements like active metals, transition metals, non-metals, metalloids, inert gases, lanthanoids and actinoids.

VII) Due to the separation of the two sub-groups, dissimilar elements (e.g alkali metals and coinage metals) donâ€™t fall together.

VIII) The lanthanoids and actinoids have been given a separate place at the bottom of the periodic table due to their analogous chemical behaviour.

IX) This arrangement of the elements is easy to remember and to reproduce.
